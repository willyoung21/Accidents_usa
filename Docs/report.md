## Project Objectives

The primary objective of this project is to perform an exhaustive analysis of traffic accident data in the United States to identify patterns, common causes, and potential areas for intervention to improve road safety. The project focuses on:

- **Data Extraction**: Collecting relevant data from reliable sources.
- **Data Cleaning and Transformation**: Ensuring the data is accurate and in a format suitable for analysis.
- **Data Analysis**: Applying statistical and data analysis techniques to derive meaningful insights.
- **Data Visualization**: Creating visual representations that facilitate the understanding of findings.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several directories, each with a specific purpose:

- **data/**: Contains raw and processed data files.
- **Docs/**: Documentation, reports, and presentations related to the project.
- **Notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks documenting the data analysis process.
- **src/**: Python scripts for data extraction, cleaning, and visualization.
- **requirements.txt**: File listing all project dependencies.

### Description of Key Files

- `data/us_accidents_raw.csv`: Original data extracted from public sources.
- `data/us_accidents_cleaned.csv`: Processed data ready for analysis.
- `Docs/report.md`: Detailed report on the analysis performed.
- `Notebooks/etl_cleaning.ipynb`: Notebook documenting the data cleaning and transformation process.
- `Notebooks/visualizations.ipynb`: Notebook containing visualizations generated from the cleaned data.
- `src/data_cleaning.py`: Script that automates the data cleaning process.
- `src/visualization.py`: Script for generating visualizations.

## Data Extraction

### Data Sources Description

The primary data source used in this project is a public dataset on traffic accidents in the United States. These data are sourced from several open data platforms, including:

- **NHTSA (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration)**: The primary source of data on accidents and road safety in the U.S.
- **FARS (Fatality Analysis Reporting System)**: A database that collects detailed information on fatal accidents.
- **Data.gov**: A portal providing access to open data from the U.S. government.

### Extraction Process

Data extraction is performed using the `extract.py` script, which automates the download and storage of the necessary data. This script allows for:

- **Automated Download**: Retrieve data files from specified URLs.
- **Validation**: Verify the integrity of the downloaded data using checksums (hashes).
- **Structured Storage**: Save the data in the appropriate format to facilitate subsequent cleaning and analysis.

```python
# Example of data extraction code
import requests

def download_data(url, save_path):
    response = requests.get(url)
    with open(save_path, 'wb') as file:
        file.write(response.content)

download_data('https://data.gov/us_accidents.csv', 'data/us_accidents_raw.csv')
```

## Data Cleaning and Transformation

### Identifying and Handling Missing Data

One of the most critical steps in data preparation is identifying and handling missing values. In this project, the following strategies are applied:

- **Row Removal with Excessive Missing Values**: If a row has more than 50% missing values, it is removed.
- **Data Imputation**: For key columns with missing values, the mean, median, or mode is used to fill in the gaps as appropriate.
- **Dummy Variable Creation**: For categorical values, dummy variables are created to represent the absence of data.

### Data Normalization

To ensure data is in a consistent format, normalization is applied to certain columns. This includes:

- **Date and Time**: Convert all dates to a standard date-time format (ISO 8601).
- **Units of Measurement**: Convert all units of measurement to a consistent system (e.g., miles to kilometers).
- **Categorical Encoding**: Convert categorical variables into numerical codes for easier analysis.

### Anomaly Detection and Correction

Anomalies, or outliers, can distort analysis if not handled properly. Various techniques are used to detect and correct them:

- **Box Plots**: Used to identify outliers in numerical distributions.
- **Business Rules**: Application of logical rules to detect values that should not occur (e.g., negative speeds).
- **Automatic Correction**: Adjustment of extreme outliers to appropriate percentiles or removal of records if necessary.

### Generating the Cleaned Dataset

Finally, the cleaned dataset is saved as `us_accidents_cleaned.csv`, ready for further analysis. This file contains only validated, consistent, and error-free data.

## Data Analysis

### Descriptive Analysis

Descriptive analysis is the first step in understanding the data structure. In this project, the following descriptive analyses were performed:

- **Accident Distribution by State**: Analysis of accident frequency across different states.
- **Accident Types**: Classification of accidents by type (head-on, side-impact, etc.).
- **Key Factors**: Identification of common factors associated with accidents, such as weather conditions, time of day, etc.

```python
import pandas as pd

# Example of descriptive analysis
data = pd.read_csv('data/us_accidents_cleaned.csv')
state_distribution = data['state'].value_counts()
print(state_distribution)
```

### Trend Analysis

Trend analysis allows for the identification of temporal patterns in accident data:

- **Annual and Monthly Trends**: Analysis of how accidents vary throughout the year and between years.
- **Peak Hours**: Identification of the times of day with the highest number of accidents.
- **Day of the Week Analysis**: Evaluation of which days of the week see the most accidents.

### Geospatial Analysis

Given that the data includes geographic coordinates, geospatial analysis is performed to identify accident hotspots:

- **Heat Maps**: Creation of heat maps to visualize accident concentrations in different regions.
- **Geographic Clustering**: Application of clustering algorithms (e.g., DBSCAN) to identify areas with high accident density.
- **Geospatial Correlation Analysis**: Evaluation of the correlation between geographic location and other accident factors.

## Data Visualization

### Trend Visualization

Visualizations are an essential part of analysis, as they help to communicate findings clearly and effectively:

- **Bar Charts**: To compare the number of accidents between different states, accident types, etc.
- **Time Series**: To visualize the evolution of accidents over time.
- **Histograms**: To show the distribution of numerical variables, such as speed at the time of the accident.

### Maps and Geospatial Analysis

Geospatial visualizations are crucial for understanding where accidents occur and how they are geographically distributed:

- **Heat Maps**: Used to identify accident concentrations in specific areas.
- **Point Maps**: To show the exact distribution of accidents in a region.

### Other Important Visualizations

In addition to the visualizations mentioned, other types of visualizations are also created to explore different aspects of the data:

- **Scatter Plots**: To analyze the relationship between two variables, such as speed and accident severity.
- **Correlation Matrix**: To identify significant correlations between multiple variables.

## Conclusions and Recommendations

This project has identified several important patterns and trends in U.S. traffic accident data. Some key conclusions include:

- **Geographic Hotspots**: Identification of areas with high concentrations of accidents, suggesting the need for targeted interventions.
- **Temporal Trends**: Significant variations in accident frequency based on time of day, day of the week, and time of year.
- **Risk Factors**: Determination of factors that significantly contribute to the occurrence of accidents, such as adverse weather conditions and speeding.

### Recommendations

Based on the findings from this analysis, the following recommendations can be made:

- **Improve Safety in Hotspots**: Implement road safety measures in areas identified with high accident density.
- **Awareness Campaigns**: Focus road safety awareness campaigns on times and days of the week when accidents are most frequent.
- **Further Research**: Conduct more detailed studies in specific areas

 to better understand the factors contributing to accidents.
